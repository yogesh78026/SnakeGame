Snake Game | Python üêç
Overview
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player maneuvers a snake to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length, and the game continues until the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area. This project is implemented in Python, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure the code and enhance maintainability and scalability.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: The game allows users to control the snake using the keyboard arrows, providing a responsive and engaging user experience.  

Object-Oriented Design: The game logic is organized using OOP concepts, making the code modular, reusable, and easy to understand.  

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game employs the Turtle graphics library to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface.  

Real-time Updates: The game continuously updates the snake's position, checks for collisions, and refreshes the screen to reflect the current game state.
